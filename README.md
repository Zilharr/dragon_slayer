# random_weapon_generator
A short demonstration of using classes/inheritance/polymorphism in python.

With a few inputs the user will generate a random weapon type with a random name and element. All inputs will have error handling.

1) The user selects a class i.e. Wizard, Warrior, Rogue, or Priest
2) The user inputs a class-specific stat like strength or intelligence
3) The class-specific class is created and based on the random chance derived from the class-specific stat a weapon is created and a random name and element are assigned
4) The result is printed to the terminal
